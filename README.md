![Recycle City Movement](RCM.png) **Greetings!**</b>

So here is something to do that is worthy of your time while here are on Earth. What is that? Create a system of service-to-others.

**Start A Revolution**</b>

In this revolution of system-inversion, you can help create freedom and prosperity, through responsibility and cooperation, and an advanced civilization of inclusion and charity.</b>

**Why Now**</b>

This is the time of transition where the old system falls away, and a new one is born. What operating system will the people create? This is where Recycle City Movement (RCM) comes in. Many people need to remove the programming of the previous system and learn to think for themselves, to learn to take responsibility for their actions and thoughts, and to work with others towards harmony and balance. This is a time of opportunity, not to protest the end of the old, but to create a new one. Why don't people create a service-to-other system during a revolution? They don't know what a service-to-other system is. So RCM steps up by defining a rudimentary system that uses the old system for support with a charity model, where recycled products are given away, where the ecosystem is nurtured, and people work together.

**The Recycling Paradigm**</br>

The recycling paradigm is inspired by reality. The eternal flow of energy, creation, and responsibility all mirror recycling, the circular flow. Recycling is power traveling in a circle. Recycling is also a technological system of advancement, as the way things are done can always be improved upon. When the goal is to improve a recycling process by reducing waste, one is taking responsibility for the environment and the self. When taking responsibility, as part of daily practices, the individual's purpose becomes energetically higher. The higher mind comes into play, where inspiration, genius, honor and integrity reside. In time, as technology is improved, a technology tree grows. This is a tree of knowledge, and is how the technological development process works. RCM would document the tree, and share it, an act of love. In so doing, process patterns can be discovered through analysis, an act of caring, for the goal of further improving production and recycling efforts. On this path, the quality of life improves in a myriad of ways.

**Where To Start**</b>

I recommend downloading the website repository and perusing the website from the 'index.html' page. If your willing to study, you will find that the welcome page has links to the RCM charter and business plan, and the community page has links to the community charter and community business plan.

Make the movement your own if you like. It is a just an idea and is meant to be shared. If you want to work on the website, any help on this repository would create a unifying field.

**How To Be A RCM Volunteer?**</b>

Website designers and programmers are needed. The website code is in need of reviews, fixes, improvements, and code.</b>

Legal expertise and/or insight is needed. The business plans and charters need to be reviewed and constructively critiqued, for possible legal issues, and any other concerns. Future legal issues need to be brought to light, so they may be addressed.</b>

Editors with knowledge of the English language are needed to review the charters and business plans for weaknesses such ambiguity, inconsistency, incorrect grammar, and spelling errors.</b>

Planners and experienced developers are needed to raise issues for the website designers and legal experts.</b>

Finance experts are needed to help design a business finance model that can work with three financial officers. How can bank transactions be processed where three people sign-off on, that is to say approve, a transaction?

Everyone is needed to share the call for RCM volunteers.

**About me:**</b>
I first conceived of the Recycle City Movement (RCM), on March 18th, 2020, while meditating in bed. Once the idea had sprung, my heart must have activated, as I jumped from my bed, and started writing the idea down. I was over-whelmed with joy. I knew it was an epiphany. Ever since that moment I have been filled with passion to see RCM realized.</b>

Yes, RCM is a seed. I would see it grow, as any life form does, with the care of others. So, it is is my hope that you would adopt RCM as your own, by volunteering to help, as there is much to be done.</b>
