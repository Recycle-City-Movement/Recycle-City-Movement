Thank you for comming! We've made it this far. Let's keep it going.</b>

**Start A Revolution**</b>

I recommend downloading the website repository and perusing the website from the 'index.html' page. If your willing to study, you will find that the welcome page has links to the RCM charter and business plan, and the community page has links to the community charter and community business plan.

I am working on website everyday. So, you may also want to come back later and check it out.

**How To Be A RCM Volunteer?**</b>

Website designers and programmers are needed. The website code is in need of reviews, fixes, improvements, and code.</b>

Legal expertise and/or insight is needed. The business plans and charters need to be reviewed and constructively critiqued, for possible legal issues, and any other concerns. Future legal issues need to be brought to light, so they may be addressed.</b>

Editors with knowledge of the English language are needed to review the charters and business plans for weaknesses such ambiguity, inconsistency, incorrect grammar, and spelling errors.</b>

Planners and experienced developers are needed to raise issues for the website designers and legal experts.</b>

Finance experts are needed to help design a business finance model that can work with three financial officers. How can bank transactions be processed where three people sign-off on, that is to say approve, a transaction?

Everyone is needed to share the call for RCM volunteers.

**About me:**</b>
I first conceived of the Recycle City Movement (RCM), on March 18th, 2020, while meditating in bed. Once the idea had sprung, my heart must have activated, as I jumped from my bed, and started writing the idea down. I was over-whelmed with joy. I knew it was an epiphany. Ever since that moment I have been filled with passion to see RCM realized.</b>

Yes, RCM is my baby. I would see it grow, as a child does, with the care of others. So, it is is my hope that you would adopt RCM as your own, by volunteering to help, as there is much to be done.</b>
