    <h4>The Active Status</h4>
    <p>
      In order to remain on the active status, a member must sign-in or be

    <h4>Classes</h4>
    <p>
      <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
      classifies members by their level of responsibility.
      Responsibility is earned by taking an action that benefits
      <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
      or a supported community. There are areas of responsibility that
      reflect the consequences of the action. These areas have impact
      on others and
      <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>.
      The measurement of this impact is how
      <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
