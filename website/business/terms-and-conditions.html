      classifies members by their level of responsibility. Responsibility is
      earned by taking an action that benefits
      <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
      or a supported community. There are areas of responsibility that reflect
      the consequences of the action. These areas have impact on others and
      <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>. The measurement of this
      impact is how
      <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
      ranks responsibility, and classifies, its members.
