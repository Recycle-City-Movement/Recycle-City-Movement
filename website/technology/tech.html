        The technology section is for sharing recycling technology. The
        documents would be organized by common factors.

        The following text represent some fictional posts of how technology
        could be shared by people from a sponsored RCM community named Hydrogen
        City:

      <h4>Greenhouse</h4>
      <h5>Star Commander from Hydrogen City (3/8/3111)</h5>
      <p>
        The latest greenhouse is completed. Using the hinges to connect the
        supports made the structure flexible and strong. We are hoping that the
        dug-out and drains will protect the structure from the wind and rain.

      <h4>Excreta</h4>
      <h5>Numoon Sensa from Hydrogen City (5/8/3112)</h5>
      <p>
        The rubber bricks are proving to be very suitable for the underground
        structural requirements. Regarding the underground structures, I think
        the earth conduits will produce enough electrical current to run most of
        the planned systems. Everyone is very happy that the excreta recycling
        mech is now underground as the smell of the methane was undesirable. It
        was profound how the 'green above, silver below' paradigm motivated
        everyone as the build-out of the underground had to be done with much
        care and planning.

      <h5>Davey Rockfella from Hydrogen City (6/12/3113)</h5>
      <p>
        We moved the excreta recycling system to the new underground spaces. The
        air circulation system still needs work, and Numoon is still testing
        some ideas.

      <h5>Trappen Paradise from Hydrogen City (9/9/3113)</h5>
      <p>
        I have to say we are pleased to announce that the waterfall pool is
        finished. Star's idea for making the pump self-cleaning was brilliant.
        We will still have to watch the algae and ph levels, as the mineral and
        metal ionization process has some side-effects and still needs work.
