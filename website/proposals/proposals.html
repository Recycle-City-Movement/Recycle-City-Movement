      <h3>Proposals</h3>
      <p>
        Any member can make a proposal. The member fills out and submits a
        proposal from the choices below so that it may be voted upon by the
        voter pool. The voter pool is dynamic in that it is created from the
        <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
        active membership ranks. There are different kinds of proposals that
        members can create:
      </p>
    </br>
      <ul>
        <li>a new community;</li>
        <li>support an existing community;</li>
        <li>a miscellaneous charity fund donation;</li>
        <li>a change to a business document or process.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Proposals go through phases:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          During the first week a proposal is classified as a new proposal.</br></br>
        </li>
        <li>
          After seven days, the proposal is judged by the number of votes it has
          received.</br></br>
        </li>
        <li>
          If the proposal receives votes of at least 33% of its voter pool, it
          becomes active.</br></br>
        </li>
        <li>
          At this stage, if the proposal is not active, it is deleted from the
          ballot box and archived. The proposal is dead.</br></br>
        </li>
        <li>
          The active proposal continues to remain in the ballot box for an
          additional week, receiving votes.</br></br>
        </li>
        <li>
          At the end of the two week period, the proposal is judged for its
          value. If the proposal has received votes from more than 50% of its
          voter pool, then it is viewed as valued. Otherwise, the proposal is
          dead.</br></br>
        </li>
        <li>
          If the valued proposal received more than 50% of the votes in its
          favor, then the proposal is adopted, and its implementation process
          begins. Otherwise, the proposal is dead.</br></br>
        </li>
        <li>
          During the implementation of the valued proposal, the admins work with
          each other to sort out what changes need to take place, and what
          actions need to occur. Also a progress report is created
          and maintained, that is visible from the
          <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
          website, detailing the steps taken to implement the proposal.</br></br>
        </li>
        <li>
          If the proposal is a community funding proposal, then the Community
          Contract is involved. Thus the would-be Community Founder, the initiator,
          is notified of the proposal's outcome,
          and given a detailed documentation on what steps need to be completed for
          the funding to finalize.</br></br>
          Most importantly, the initiator and an additional two
          community representatives sign and notarize the Community Contract
          and submit the contract to a designated
          <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
          finance administrator.
          <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
          will then review the contract and sign-off on it by having two
          finance admins and one addition administrator sign the contract.
          This is the final phase of community
          funding proposal and lasts as long as ninety days. If a contract is not
          signed by
          <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
          admin and the community representatives in that period of time, the
          proposal dies.
        </br></br>
          If a completed contract is done on time, then it archived on the
          <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
          website. If it is a new community funding, then a fund distribution
          transfer is completed by
          the coordination of two
          <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
          finance admins.
        </li>
      </ol>
