      <h3>Proposals</h3>
      <p>There are different kinds of proposals that members can create:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a new community</li>
        <li>a charity fund donation</li>
        <li>a change to a business document or process</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Proposals go through phases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          During the first week a proposal is classified as a new proposal.
        </li>
        <li>
          The proposal is then judged by the number of votes it has received.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the proposal receives votes of at least 33% of its voter pool, it
          becomes active.
        </li>
        <li>
          At this stage, if the proposal is not active, it is deleted from the
          ballot box.
        </li>
        <li>
          The active proposal continues to remain in the ballot box for an
          additional week, receiving votes.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the end of the two week period the fate of the proposal is
          determined.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the proposal received more than 50% of the votes in its favor, then
          the proposal is adopted, and its implementation process begins.
        </li>
      </ul>
