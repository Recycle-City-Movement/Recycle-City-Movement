    <h2>The Recycle City Movement Charter</h2>
    
    <p>
      The purpose of this charter is to define the goals of the Recycle City Movement (RCM),
      its philosophy and moral center.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Goals of the Recycle City Movement
    </h3>
    

    <h3>
      Establish a Charity Fund
    </h3>

    <p>
      Create and sustain a charity fund which is solely
      used to support the RCM website and RCM chartered communities.
    </p>

    <p>
      The RCM prioritizes fund distribution in four levels.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first priority: Expenses of the RCM website are to be covered, and
      a portion of the fund is reserved to cover a projected six months of RCM operating expense.
      These expenses are expected to be minimal and mostly relate to hosting
      and legal observations, but are not limited by such,
      and thus expandable by the democratic process of the RCM fund supporters.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second priority: Support community founders.
      Community founders are individuals that seek out funding
      through the process of submitting a detailed proposal. The proposals details
      purchasable assets, and a very basic community plan.
      Active RCM charity fund supporters then decide, through a vote, the proposal's merit.
    </p>

    <p>
      The third priority: Distribute equal portions of the fund in monthly
      allotments to established RCM chartered communities which are in their growth phase.
      At this phase, the quarterly distributions are also factored in.
      Whatever funds are available after the first two priorities have been met,
      are then distributed by this calculation.

    </p>

    <p>
      The fourth priority: Distribute equal portions of the fund on a three-month cycle
      to established RCM chartered communities which are no longer growing.
      The amount this distribution is factored in with the monthly division.
    </p>

    <p>
      The charity fund is intended to be an open and transparent vessel in that
      RCM publishes, on a monthly basis, the charity fund's bank statement onto the website.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Definition Of A Community
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      A location made with people, animals and things, where the people live
      in unified manner, sharing common goals that are created by survival and developmental needs,
      the pursuit of happiness, and the desires to give, grow, and share.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Definition Of A RCM Chartered Community
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      This is a community that has signed a RCM Community Charter
      and RCM Community Business Plan. The responsible contract
      assignee is to consist of three individuals,
      that are either community founders or chosen community members.
    </p>

    <p>
      Upon signing a charter, the new or existing community
      is to automatically receive funds, at RCM's discretion, in the form of an initial payment,
      and/or to be added to queue of the qualified cyclic payments.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      Staffing RCM
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      The RCM business is run entirely from the internet,
      with the exception of possible travel expenditures related to RCM Community support.
      The business is run by an elected administration,
      chosen from valued volunteers, by valued volunteers.
      This staff is redundantly designed, with this elected staff in threes,
      where three people share the responsibility of a central role.
      Central roles are the high responsibility jobs that revolve around finance,
      legal issues, the website, and communications.
      This volunteer elected staff forms the organization's board of directors of twelve members.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Propositions, Elections and The Democratic Process
    </h3>

    <p>
      The RCM business uses propositions to initiate change in the business design
      and operations. Each proposition is categorized by the board after careful
      consideration of the area of responsibility. Membership voting is an earned privilege,
      and is sorted into levels of responsibility that reflect the scope of the area.
      Members gain responsibility and hence voting privileges, through their actions.
      The propositions themselves can be proposed by any RCM member at anytime,
      and can raise any business issue imaginable.
      The RCM board of directors is an elected body,
      chosen through an election of the RCM membership's top two levels:
      administration and their assistants.
      The election process repeats cyclically every six months. As part of this process,
      the administration and assistants are empowered to nominate the administration candidates
      for the coming cycle. These are willing candidates from the existing administration
      and the assistant level.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Open And Transparent
    </h3>
    <p>
      The business seeks to make its operations open and transparent.
      Financial records are published on the website with the monthly bank statement.
      With privacy and security consideration, administration and business functions,
      where documentation is created or modified, are published on the public website.
    </p>

    <p>
      As part of becoming a responsible RCM member, new members agree to make publicly
      visible on the website their: votes, financial donations, staff position,
      member classification, and community preferences, such as
      their willingness to be promoted or join a community. Of course,
      membership identity and privacy is protected with the greatest care. However,
      as part of becoming an administration nominee, assistant and admin members
      agree to allow a disclosure of their rightful first and last name,
      which is then also visible in the member's profile.
    </p>

    <p>
      The website's source code remains published on GitHub.com, or another suitable venue.
      Proposed website modifications are done by volunteers at GitHub.com.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Lawful Consideration
    </h3>
    <p>
      Staying within the boundaries set by lawful entities is a primary concern
      of every RCM staff member when conducting company business.
      An essential goal of the company is to raise awareness of these boundaries
      through written and verbal communication in ways that persist, or repeat,
      for the sake of legal compliance, and to create a company that takes responsibility
      for its actions.
    </p>

    <h3>
      RCM Philosophy
    </h3>
    <p>
      RCM promotes that its membership recognize in one another their differences
      and similarities, that each individual is responsible for their actions,
      and recognize that each individual is a sovereign being with a unique point-of-view,
      a cherished life, created by a higher power. In so doing, RCM hopes its members
      treat each other as equals.
