    <h2>
      The Recycle City Movement Business Plan
    </h2>
    
    <h3>
      Goal and Motivation
    </h3>

    <p>
      Create an non-profit organization of the highest moral integrity.
      Improve the lives of everyone through self-empowerment. Sponsor the
      initial creation of communities, which are themselves non-profit organizations,
      that follow the
      <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
      community business charter and plan.
      Continue to sustain these communities
      through monthly and quarterly payouts.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Operation
    </h3>

    <p>
      Dealings are open and transparent. For example, meetings are recorded
      and shared with the public. Internal workings of the organization,
      such as external and internal communications, are visible from the website.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Labor
    </h3>

    <p>
      The organization is staffed entirely by volunteers.
      Responsible and productive volunteers get rewarded with greater responsibilities,
      such as job tasks and voting privileges.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Finance
    </h3>

    <p>
      Financial transactions are open and transparent. For example,
      the charity fund bank statement is posted on the
      <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
      website on a monthly basis.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Reproducible Model
    </h3>

    <p>
      The business model is reproducible by others. The website reflects
      the openness of the business. Website source code is open-source.
      Business design and technology are documented with the website.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Assets
    </h3>

    <p>
      The business's only assets are the
      <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
      website and its charity fund bank account.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Security and Privacy
    </h3>

    <p>
      The protection of the charity fund, member private information and credit card information
      is a fundamental responsibility of all staff members.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Technology
    </h3>

    <p>
      Promote the use and improvement of recycling technology by documenting
      and sharing the technology documentation used by communities and other potential entities.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Democracy
    </h3>

    <p>
      The organization control is done by elections and propositions.
      Members earn the right to vote by their commitment, that is to say by volunteering,
      and by their financial support of the
      <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
      charity fund.
      How the business operates is in the hands of the volunteers and the fund supporters.
