    <h2>
      The Community Business Plan
    </h2>

    <h3>
      Goal and Motivation
    </h3>

    <p>
      Create a non-profit organization of the highest moral integrity.
      Improve the lives of everyone through self-empowerment.
      Encourage growth of the community within self-defined limits.
      Sustain the community through a business model that funds a unity trust fund
      and a recycling charity fund.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Non-Profit Organization
    </h3>

    <p>
      The community uses the RCM community website template to create
      its own non-profit website. The website enables the community to share
      with the greater population. The community charter and community business plan
      are published on the website, the community's member profiles are shared,
      and the community's recycled products are defined, and their availability listed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The community is a non-profit organization in that it gives away recycled products.
      The community-created recycled products are first put to use by the community,
      as the community sees fit.
      If there are any extra recycled products, then these are shared freely
      via a request-for-product process that is made available on the community's website.
      The greater population places requests for the recycled product through the
      community's website, in the same manner as a customer might place an order.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is an example of how this works. The community has chickens,
      which then produce chicken manure. The chicken manure is composted by the community.
      The recycled product is chicken-manure compost.
      The community uses the chicken-manure compost to fertilize its garden and crops.
      Now, there is still chicken-manure compost that is continuing to pile up.
      The community posts on its non-profit website that a measure of
      chicken-manure compost is available.
      The population has a need for the chicken-manure composts and
      requests a quantity of the compost.
      The community agrees to the request, and arraignments, such as a schedule,
      are made for the delivery or pick-up of
      the compost by the requester at the requester's expense.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Operation
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      Dealings are open and transparent. For example, community meetings
      are open to every member. Some internal workings of the organization,
      such as project plans, are visible from their website.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Labor And Finance
    </h3>

    <p>
      The community business' authority structure is non-hierarchical, 
      where each member has equal status and empowerment with the exception of
      the community's finances. The community has three elected financial officers
      who as a unit manage the unity and charity funds.
      The community performs financial officer elections every six months from
      a candidates nominated or volunteered from the community.
    </p>

    <p></p>
      Financial transactions are open and transparent.
      For example, the unity and charity fund bank statements are posted
      on the RCM website on a monthly basis.

      Each member receives an equal unity fund distribution as indicated previously.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Reproducible Model
    </h3>

    <p>
      The community business model is reproducible by others.
      The community's website reflects the openness of the business.
      Website source code is open-source. Business design and technology
      are documented with the website.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Technology
    </h3>

    <p>
      Promote the use and improvement of recycling technology by documenting
      and sharing the technology documentation used by the community on its community website.
      The community recognizes that recycling waste into useful products
      is needed so that the community can continue to thrive in harmony,
      and responsibly with the ecosystem.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Democracy
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      The business organization control is done by elections and propositions.
      All members have voting rights, within reason.
