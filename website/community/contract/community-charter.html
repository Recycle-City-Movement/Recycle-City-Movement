    <h3>
      The Recycle City Movement Community Charter
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      The purpose of this charter is to define the goals, philosophy and moral center of the community:
      _________________________________________________________________________________, which is here-on-in referred to as community.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Goals Of The Community
    </h3>

    <h3>
      Establish A Unity Trust Fund
    </h3>

    <p>
      Create and sustain a unity trust und which is solely used to support the community and its members.
    </p>

    <p>
      This charter prioritizes the unity fund distribution in two levels.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first priority: Expenses of the community are to be covered.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second priority: Support community members.
      Every member, within reason, receives an equal payout when the opportunity prevails.
      Children, the infirm, and new members are examples of possible exception to this clause.
    </p>

    <p>
      The unity fund is an open and transparent vessel the unity fund's bank statement
      is published, on a monthly basis, onto the community's website.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Establish A Non-profit Organization
    </h3>

    <p>
      The community agrees to establish a non-profit organization that serves
      the greater population by freely donating recycled products.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Establish A Non-profit RCM Charity Fund
    </h3>

    <p>
      The purpose of this charity fund is to enable recycling efforts done by the community.
      The fund is sustained by donations made through the community's website,
      and other donation channels. On the community's website,
      the non-profit's recycling related information is shared:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the recycling technology that is used,
        </li>

        <li>
          any recycled products that are created,
        </li>
          
        <li>
          the community's plan for improving its recycling efforts and products,
        </li>

        <li>
          and the charity fund's bank statement.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>
      Share Community Recycled Products
    </h3>

    <p>
      The community agrees to freely donate to third-party entities any recycled products
      that the community has no need of, or that is to say, not needed to sustain the community.
      The community uses its non-profit website to post recycled products availability,
      and to take requests for these recycled products. The community provides
      the recycled product on a first-come-first-served basis. Limits are placed on requests,
      where the community reserves the right to limit a request amount based on the number
      of benefiting end-users of the requester. The requesters when placing requests agree
      to pay for any shipping costs for delivery of the recycled products.
      These costs are posted on the website with the product availability.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Definition Of A Community
    </h3>

    <p>
      A location made with people, animals and things, where the people live
      in a unified manner, sharing common goals that are
      created by survival and developmental needs,
      the pursuit of happiness, and the desires to give, grow, and share.
    </p>


    <h3>
      Joining The Community
    </h3>

    <p>
      If the community is in a growth state, the new community members
      are invited to join on the community's website.
      The community allows people to join based on the
      person's desire to join and serve the community.
    </p>

    <p>
      Members are given equal rights as pertaining to job opportunity, housing,
      medical care, and dietary requirements. Each member treats every other member
      as an equal, within reason, and especially in terms of equal rights.
      Children, the infirm, and new members are examples of possible exception to this clause.
    </p>

    <p>
      The community shares its goals with every member, and lets members choose how they will serve,
      what jobs they wish to take on, and how they will spend their time.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Open And Transparent
    </h3>

    <p>
      The community seeks to make its operations open and transparent to the greater population.
      Thus financial records of the community's unity fund and the community's
      RCM charity fund are published
      on the community's website in the form of their monthly bank statement.
      The community's website's source code remains published on GitHub.com or another
      open-source development website.
      Each member of the community has a visible profile on the community's website.
      The personal information disclosed is left to the community's discretion.
      The community shares stories, recycling-related technical documentation,
      and recycled product availability on the community's website.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Lawful Consideration
    </h3>

    <p>
      Staying within the boundaries set by lawful entities is a primary concern of every
      community member when conducting community business.
      An essential goal of the company is to raise awareness of these boundaries
      through written and verbal communication in ways that persist, or repeat,
      for the sake of legal compliance, and to create a community that takes responsibility
      for its actions.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Community Philosophy
    </h3>

    <p>
      The community actively promotes a philosophy where members recognize in one another
      their differences and similarities,
      respect that each individual is responsible for their actions,
      and recognize that each individual is a sovereign being
      with a unique point-of-view, a cherished life, created by a higher power.
      In so doing, the community hopes its members treat each other as equals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Responsible members agree upon signing to share this community charter
      with their community, and to encourage their community to abide by the contract's terms.
    </p>

    <p>
