      <h3>Community</h3>
      <p>The community page is for development and connecting communities.</p>
      <h4>Development</h4>
      <p>
        <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
        funds the development of new communities and the transformation of
        existing communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you'd like to become a Community Founder, one who purchases land and
        other assets for establishing a community, or if you'd like to establish
        funding for your existing community, then first read the community
        <a href="contract/community-charter.html" target="main-content"
          >charter</a
        >
        and community
        <a href="contract/community-biz-plan.html" target="main-content"
          >business plan </a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
        has a few requirements for supporting communities:
      </p>
      <p>
        The first step is to get funding approved. This is done by submitting a
        proposal for a new community or an existing community.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the proposal is accepted by the voting pool.
        <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
        will ask that the community founder to complete two incorporation
        processes. The community needs two incorporate two legal entities:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Create a non-profit organization that donates recycled products to the
          greater population. The community produces the products, and takes
          donations to the non-profit's charity fund that it owns and promotes
          on a community website.
          <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
          has a community website template that communities can use to
          facilitate the website creation process.
        </li>
        <li>
          Incorporate a for-profit business that funds a unity fund. This fund
          pays community expenses and its members. Most of the business model is
          up to community. This is an opportunity for a community to sustain
          itself by producing goods and/or services from a functioning business.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The last step to becoming a supported
        <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
        community is that three community members, and the three
        <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
        finance administrators, need to sign a
        <abbr title="Recycle City Movement">RCM</abbr>
        community contract. The contract is composed of a community
        <a href="contract/community-charter.html">charter</a>
        and a community
        <a href="contract/community-biz-plan.html">business plan</a>.
      </p>
